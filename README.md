# EventListiner
This project demonstrates a simple and straightforward way of creating a custom Event Listener in Java. The Event Listener consists of three parts:

1. The Event Listener Interface that defines the interaction between Event Sources and Event Listeners
2. The Event Source which registers Listeners, generates Events, and notifies Listeners
3. Listeners which implement the Event Listener interface and respond to Events

This project also includes a class that demonstrates the implementation these three components.

I hope this is helpful.
